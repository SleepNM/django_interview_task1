There are tasks:

Task 1:
Add to the user model new field, to store their unique employee identification (alphanumeric).
This field is not mandatory, and it should be read-only when user status is active.

Add field to list and form view.

Task 2:
In the form view of user, display user login count. We should be able to see how many times user logged in.
If necessary  add functionality to get how many times user tried to login (depends from Framework, as some of them already do have DB structure for this).

Task 3:
On user form view, add button "Login As", that button will execute functionality that we login as that user.
Only admins can see/execute this functionality.
